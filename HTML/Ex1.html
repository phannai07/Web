	<h1>1. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>
		You'll need this tag at the begginning of every HTML document you create. It ensures that a 
		<br>browser knows that it's reading HTML, and that it expects HTML5, the latest version.
	</p>
	<p>
		Even though this isn't actually an HTML tag, it's still a good one to know.
	</p>
	<h1>2. &lt;html&gt;</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>
		The is another tag that tells a browser that it's reading HTML. The &lt;html&gt; tag goes 
		<br>straight after the DOCTYPE tag and you chose it with a &lt;/html&gt; tag right at the end of your <br>file.Everything else in your document goes between these tags.
	</p>
	<h1>3. &lt;head&gt;</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>
		The &lt;head&gt; tag start the header section of your file. The stuff that goes in here doesn't <br>appear on your webpage. Instead, It contains metadata for search engines, and into for 
		<br>your brower.
