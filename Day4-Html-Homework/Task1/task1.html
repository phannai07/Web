    <h1>My First Webpage</h1>
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is photography. There's something magical about capturing a moment in time that can never be recreated. As Ansel Adams once said, "You don't take a photograph, you make it."</p>
    <h2>What I Enjoy About Photography:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Exploring new places and seeing the world from different angles</li>
        <li>Being creative with lighting and composition</li>
        <li>Preserving memories that tell stories</li>
    </ul>
